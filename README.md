# Airbnb-s-Booking-Data-Analysis-Using-Power-BI
Embark on a journey through Airbnb's Booking Data Analysis using Power BI! Delve into this repository where I've meticulously analyzed Airbnb's booking data to uncover valuable insights and trends. From occupancy rates to pricing dynamics, each Power BI report provides a comprehensive view of Airbnb's business landscape. Additionally, explore the dashboard I've crafted, offering detailed visualizations and interactive elements for deeper analysis.

I have covered the following project goals for the analysis:-

• Assessing District Location Scores: The aim is to pinpoint the location in the 
district with the least favorable location scores.

• Examining Host Response Time Impact: The goal is to delve into the 
relationship between host response times and the overall ratings of Airbnb 
listings providing valuable insights.

• Visualizing Airbnb Listing Prices: The objective is to create visual 
representations of Airbnb listing prices across different cities and summarize 
any noteworthy trends or variations.

• Analyzing Composite Scores: The task involves creating a composite score 
that integrates check-in experience and host communication for various 
districts with subsequent analysis and insights.

• Calculating Listing Age and Host Tenure: This objective entails computing the 
age of Airbnb listings and identifying hosts who have accumulated more than 
ten years of hosting expertise.

Property Type Price Analysis: The task involves the creation of a visual tree 
map that displays average prices for various room and property types with 
specific attention given to the property type associated with the highest prices 
for entire places.

• Crafting a Comprehensive City Insights Report: This objective entails the 
creation of a comprehensive report that presents listing prices, guest ratings, 
and visitor trends for multiple cities, with a particular focus on assessing 
changes in visitor trends in 2020 in contrast to earlier years.
